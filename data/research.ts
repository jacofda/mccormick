    title: "Chemokine & Cannabinoid receptors",
    tag: "GPCRs Cancer",
    slug: "gpcrs-cancer",
    body: "Our research focuses on dimers between Chemokine receptors and Cannabinoid receptors. These are members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Both have been shown to be overexpressed in different cancers and to contribute to proliferation, dissemination and metastasis. Several drugs have been developed to target GPCRs but their clinical success has been limited. A new concept has been emerging on the field of GPCRs: GPCRs can combine between themselves to form so called heterodimers. These complexes have signalling and regulation capability that differ from those of the individual GPCRs that make up the dimers. We believe that heterodimers may have a major role in cancer development and could be excellent therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that when these receptors are overexpressed in tumour cells they combine among themselves to form heterodimers leading to aberrant cell signalling. We believe that through understanding how these heterodimers form in cancer cells and how they alter cell signalling we can begin to design molecules that target tumour cells that express the dimers.",

    title: "Addiction",

    slug: "addiction",
    body: "One of the more intractable characteristics of drugs of abuse is their ability to subvert the reward system of the individual such that long after contact with the drug the drug-addicted subjects can experience intense drug craving, triggering compulsive drug use. This phenomenon, called cue-induced craving, where exposure to places where the drug-addict may have taken the drug, to people with whom prior drug use occurred, or to paraphernalia used to administer the drug leads to drug relapse, is clinically relevant and is a major contributor in the cycle of relapse in addiction. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is thought to be the major contributor to cue-elicited drug craving. Indeed, in laboratory animals when neutral stimuli are paired with a rewarding drug there is an increase of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and in the dorsal striatum, and these neurochemical responses are associated with drug-seeking behavior. In the brain, reward involves widespread neurocircuitry, but the most sensitive sites involve the trajectory of the medial forebrain bundle that connects the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the basal forebrain. DA is involved with reward and with the prediction of reward. All drugs of abuse activate the mesolimbic dopamine system. In fact, within the mesolimbic system the release of DA into the NAc is an absolute requirement for the induction of the abnormal cellular and behavioural response that leads to addictive behaviour. DA release is controlled by various input signals in the form of peptides and small molecules released into the VTA of the brain where they are sensed by the dopaminergic neurons that project to the NAc. Within these neurons are various receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family that translate input signals into dopamine release modulation. Traditional approaches to control drug addiction have focused on targeting neuronal receptors as single entities. Our hypothesis, based on our preliminary results, is that many of these receptors may interact in the form of receptor heteromers and these receptor heteromers confer novel functions that modulate addictive behaviours. We identify and characterize these receptor heteromers to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their function and how they can lead to addiction.",

    tag: "GPCRs Neuroscience",
    slug: "adhd",
    body: "Many symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are thought to be due to functional changes in the prefrontal cortex that is involved in signaling via dopamine and adrenaline to interact with their respective G protein-coupled receptors. We seek to identify how these two neurotransmitter pathways interact to drive cognition and identify whether receptor polymorphisms might lead to different interactions.",

    title: "Sleep and Melatonin Production",
    tag: "GPCRs Neuroscience",
    slug: "sleep-and-melatonin-production",
    body: "Over 100 million people worldwide suffer from severe sleep problems, which have major repercussions on the onset of a variety of pathologies including obesity, diabetes, and dementia to name a few. The major sleep hormone in the body is melatonin which is produced by the pineal gland. The major function of the pineal gland is to convey the light inputs received from the retina into a language understandable to the rest of the body. This is achieved through the synthesis and release of melatonin on a light and dark cycle according to the inputs from the retina and controlled by adrenergic receptors. The most impressive and mysterious aspect of the system is the rapid ability of melatonin to be produced and or degraded as the cycle changes. We have shown that part of this rapid response is due to the formation of receptor-receptor complexes (heteromers) between the adrenergic receptors α1B or β1 and the D4 dopamine receptor. We are now characterizing the mechanistic details behind this heteromer and how the complex is regulated.",

    title: "Alzheimer’s Disease",
    tag: "GPCRs Neuroscience",
    slug: "alzheimers-disease",
    body: "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. The amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), which has an unknown role in the brain, has long been suspected to be at the heart of AD. In the brain, APP is broken down into a smaller molecule called amyloid-β. Visible clumps, or plaques, of amyloid-β found in the autopsied brains of patients are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, but scientists have long debated whether the plaques are a cause of the neurodegenerative condition or a consequence of other biochemical changes associated with the disease. The cortex and hippocampus, two major brain regions that develop amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD, are the brain regions crucial for cognition. Current AD therapies mainly target proteins to modulate one specific type of neurons, the cholinergic neurons. However, neurodegeneration associated to AD is not limited to a specific neurotransmitter system such as acetyl choline, and other systems, including those related to dopamine and histamine are also deregulated in AD. Our hypothesis is that some of these neurotransmitter systems can be novel targets to protect against disease progression and or protect against the aberrant signaling that occurs upon plaque formation.",

    title: "Huntington’s Disease",
    tag: "GPCRs Neuroscience",
    slug: "huntingtons-disease",
    body: "A predominant theory of what leads to HD is the abnormal neurotransmission between the cerebral cortex and the striatum due to alterations in dopamine (DA) modulation of excitation and inhibition in the cortex and basal ganglia. Part of this abnormal neurotransmission may be due to aberrant activation of dopamine D1 receptors in the striatum. Activation of D1 receptors can lead directly to signaling cascades that induce cell death or indirectly via modification of the NMDA receptor signaling. Thus, strategies that might reduce D1 receptor signaling could prove successful towards preventing HD. Our long term goal is to understand this aberrant signaling and to identify novel targets that might reduce either dopamine D1 receptor signaling and / or NMDA receptor signaling.",

    title: "Fragile X Syndrome",
    tag: "GPCRs Neuroscience",
    slug: "fragile-x-syndrome",
    body: "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental disability in addition to a major genetic cause of autism. The symptoms of FXS show many neurological deficits, including low intelligence quotient, seizures, sensory hypersensitivity, social anxiety, hyperactivity and other common to autism. In the mouse model of FXS, the Fmr1 knockout, plasticity is enhanced and dysregulated. This plasticity has been shown to be dependent on group 1 metabotropic receptor (mGluR1 and mGluR5) stimulation of protein synthesis. It is these findings that led to the development of the mGluR theory of FXS. This theory posits that altered mGluR-dependent plasticity contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease. In support of the mGluR theory, many phenotypes in animal models of FXS are reversed by pharmaco- logical or genetic reduction of mGluR5 or downstream signaling pathways. These data and others clearly suggest that a strategy that can target both mGluR1 and mGluR5 would be a powerful approach to FXS treatment. We have identified a novel pathway that could be exploited to reduce mGluR1/5 signaling. We are currently characterizing this pathway and exploring its potential therapeutic application.",
